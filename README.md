# Zoological API

The Zoological API was created to house information about Zoos across the United States. The API has three primary database tables in addition to the user data. The main zoo table houses the basic information of the zoo pertaining to the name, location, size, and other basic info of the facility. The attraction table contains the details pertaining to the animals and other entertainment offerings of the zoo. The third main data table pertains to reviews of the zoo where a user can rate the zoo on a scale of 1 to 5, leave text comments, and recommend the zoo. 

This API is written in C#, an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft designed to work with their .Net platform. 

## Installation

Feel free to clone and explore the application:

## Usage Directions

For the best experience using the Zoo API we recommend opening the program in the IDE or code editor of your choice, we utilize [Visual Studio Code]( https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Next, run the program according to your IDE which will open the Zoo API Home Page within your designated web browser.

By clicking the API button in the top left of the navbar, the ASP.NET Web API Help Page will manifest and list all API endpoints and routes. We also have our endpoints listed per controller below, for simple ease of navigation. 

After this we utilize an API client for creating and reading the HTTP/s requests and responses. Our team enjoys the platform [Postman]( https://www.postman.com/) offers for API navigation and testing.

Explore the API at your whimsy!
